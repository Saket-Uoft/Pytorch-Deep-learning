Kaggle House Prediction Using Pytorch Deep Learning

This project aims to predict the Sales Price of the houses using a set of continuous and categorical features using Artificial Neural Network implemented in Pytorch. The categorical features were converted into categorical embeddings similar to the Word2Vec approach in order to capture the relationships between various categories. Finally, the extracted categorical embedding and continuous features were fed to a Fully connected Neural Network to predict house prices.
